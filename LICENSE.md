## 3. Attribution and Author Credibility  

One of the core principles of the GOFL is the recognition of the Author's contributions. Therefore, you are required to give proper credit to the original Author in any use, modification, or redistribution of the Software. This attribution serves to preserve the integrity and legacy of the Software, ensuring that the Author's contributions are acknowledged.

- **Preserving Author Credibility**: Any modifications or Derivative Works that substantially alter the functionality, design, or behavior of the Software must not misrepresent the original Author's contributions. You may add your own attribution, but you must clearly distinguish between your contributions and those of the original Author. Misrepresentation or failure to credit the Author appropriately may result in the termination of this license (see Section 9).

The Author encourages community contributions and forks of the Software, fostering a collaborative development environment. By making contributions or creating forks, you are contributing to the open-source ecosystem and advancing the Software’s evolution. However, certain rules apply to contributions and forks:

- **Forks Must Retain GOFL**: Any forked version of the Software must be distributed under the same license (GOFL). You are not permitted to re-license the Software under a different open-source or proprietary license, as this would violate the terms of the original license.
