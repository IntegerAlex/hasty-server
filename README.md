**Help needed**: I am looking for contributors to help me with this project. If you are interested, please let me know.

Hasty server is a simple web framework to build webserver  in a simple way. It is inspired by [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
Bascially, It is my implementation of HTTP using raw TCP Socket in Javascript.

### Usage  
 
**Common JS**

```Javascript
const Hasty = require('hasty-server');
const  server = new  Hasty();

server.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World');
});

server.listen(8080, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 8080');
});
```
    
**ES6**
